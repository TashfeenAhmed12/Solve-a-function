# code
e^x + x^3 = 9x + 1 is solved in matlab. You can solve any function by altering the code
We first write the function as f(x)= 9x +1 -e^x -x^3
Output contains an array of 2 columns
Each row represents an itereation in total 100 itereations are made
First column represents calculated values of x
Second value represents absolute approximate error
